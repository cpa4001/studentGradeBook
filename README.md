# studentGradeBook
**Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)** </br> 

 - To get an introduction in Object Oriented Programming with Java
 - To develop skills in creating software for an end user or client
 - To create a gradebook command line where a student can access their grades
		 - where teachers can edit and assign students their grades
- Learn backend programming and file handling
- Learn basic user interface (UI) programming

**Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)** </br> 
**Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)** </br> 
**Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)** </br> 
**Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)** </br> 
**Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)**
- Provost
- Planning Director
- Professors
- Students
- IT Support

**Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)**
